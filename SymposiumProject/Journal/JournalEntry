My goals for today were to finish setting up the choice buttons for the events that would occur throughout my game.
I couldn't get them appearing because of a mistake I made in my code earlier when making my string array of events.
After helping me fix that, Mr. Nockles showed me a simpler approach than the one I was going to take to continue with my code.
Created the new options buttons.
Started to set up the setting of buttons' texts and actions.
