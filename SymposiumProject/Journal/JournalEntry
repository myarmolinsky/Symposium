My goals for today were to finish setting up the choice buttons for the events that would occur throughout my game.
I couldn't get them appearing because of a mistake I made in my code earlier when making my string array of events.
After helping me fix that, Mr. Nockles showed me a simpler approach than the one I was going to take to continue with my code.
Created the new options buttons.
Started to set up the setting of buttons' texts and actions.

5/31/17
My goals for today were to continue and finish setting up the choice buttons for the events that would occur throughout my game as I didn't finish them yesterday
I finished naming all of the buttons, next I need to give all the buttons actions
Got started on giving the buttons actions, going to have to continue and hopefully finish tomorrow

6/1/17
I want to complete the actions of the buttons today and then implement the progress and health bars.
I showed Mr. Nockles my intentions for creating the action buttons and he showed me that I could make another class that would take in several parameters.
This class should make my code easier.

6/2/17
I wanted to complete the actions of the buttons today (I know I keep saying that and it doesn't seem to happen because I keep encoutnering issues)
Mr. Nockles helped me fix another part of my code relating to the actions of the buttons.
I think I'm well set now to finish the buttons soon (hopefully)

6/5/17
Today I hope to complete the actions of the buttons.
Finished setting up action buttons.
There was an issue with my display and Mr. Nockles helped me fix it.
There was an issue with my while loop that would help display, so I'm attempting to fix it.
Mr. Nockles is trying to help me fix it.

6/6/17
There is still an issue getting through the turns.  Trying to fix it.
Mr. Nockles helped me fix the issue.  Now all that's left is to display progress and health.
